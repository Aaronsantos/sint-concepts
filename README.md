Sint - concepts is a mental heath web app created for fun and study purposes.
This project is part of a case-study on creation, deployment and integration of complex front-end Products.
It uses my personal react ui-lib [Araceae-ui](https://github.com/Aaronsantos/Araceae-ui) and works along side of the [Sint - Gratitude](https://github.com/Aaronsantos/sint-gratitude) web app, which together make the main Sint conceptual product: a set of apps for mental health.

Project Roadmap:
- [X] MVP release using Araceae-UI.
- [X] Integration tests on each page and automated coverage scripts.
- [X] independent deploy and integration via common env variables.
- [ ] Uses of reverse proxy on a single AWS pod by the same domain.
